# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campagins
## Overview of Project 
I performed data anaylsis on thousands and thousands of Kickstarter projects, specificly in the play and theater genre. I created Pivot tables showing the outcomes in the theater category in the US, wheather they are sucessful, failed or have been canceled. I created a pivot tables demonstrating the  same data for subcaterogries, specificly showing the plays in the US. I created spreasheet for Descriptive Statistics showing the mean, and median of sucessful and failed goals. The spreadsheet also includes trhe median and mean of sucessful pledges and failed pledges.
### Purpose
 the purpse of this project is to determine the success rate, fail rate, and best/worst times to launch a Kickstarter in the theater, speicifcly for plays!



### Analysis Of Outcomes Based On Launch Dates
Based on the Launch Dates outcomes I have concluded that the best time to start in the theater world is in May June and July. I have also concluded that the months of November, December, and November are to be avoided.
